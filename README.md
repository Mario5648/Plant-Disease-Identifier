# Plant-Disease-Identifier
This is a convolutional neural network that analyzes a picture of a plant and will identify the type of disease of the plant.


## Problem:
With agriculture having to be pushed to the very limits inorder to feed millions of people at once, it has become way to hard for farmers to analyze the plant health fast enough all at an affordable cost. Farmers have to waste time and money in order to identify what is wrong with plants. Once the farmer gets the result it may already be too late. AI can help farmers world wide to identify what is wrong with their plants in an instant all while saving them money. 

## Dataset:
I used a dataset from kaggle. Download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/rules
