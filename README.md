# Plant-Disease-Identifier
This is a convolutional neural network that analyzes a picture of a plant and will identify the type of disease of the plant.


## Problem:
With agriculture having to be pushed to the very limits to feed millions of people at once, it has become harder for farmers to analyze plant health fast enough at an affordable cost. Farmers have to waste time and money to identify what is wrong with plants. Once the farmer gets their results, it may already be too late, resulting in the loss of cash crops. AI can help farmers worldwide to identify what is wrong with their plants in an instant all while saving them money.
